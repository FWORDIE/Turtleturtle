    <h2>How To Play</h2>
    <p>
        Your aim is to find the 4 pairs of images for 4 Turtles in the puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select 2 images you think show the same turtle and tap 'Submit' to check
        your guess.
    </p>
    <p>Find all four Turtle pairs without making 3 mistakes!</p>
    <h2>Hint</h2>
    <p>
        Turtle faces (left/right/top side) each have a unique pattern of scales,
        like fingerprints. Look for these!
    </p>
    <p>
        The patterns in opposite profiles are not exactly the same in a Turtle
        yet rather similar. Look for these similarities as well!
    </p>
    <p>Each daily game has 4 pair of difficulties and one random wildcard.</p>
